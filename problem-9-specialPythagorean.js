/* Problem 9: Special pythagorean triplet
 *
 * A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers,
 * a < b < c, for which, a^2 + b^2 = c^2
 *
 * For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 6 = 25 = 5^2
 *
 * There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which
 * a + b + c = 1000.
 * Find the product abc.
