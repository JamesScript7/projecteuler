/* Problem 12: Highly Divisible Triangle Number
 *
 * The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural
 * numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be:
 * 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
 *
 *      1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,...
 * 
 * Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
 * 
 * 1:  1
 * 3:  1,3
 * 6:  1,2,3,6
 * 10: 1,2,5,10
 * 15: 1,3,5,15
 * 21: 1,3,7,21
 * 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
 *
 * We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over
 * five divisors.
 *
 * What is the value of the first triangle number to have over
 * five hundred divisors?
